# WHY THE CUSTOM FOLDER
This just handles the building the community app image from the forked community app project with all the changes we would make to it.

# HOW LOGOS and LOADERS CAN BE HANDLED
The docker file handle how the custom images are copied to the images folder for the various organization to be deployed for.

# FOR DEVELOPERS TO NOTE
always push to Develop branch and then you can easily merge changes from the main community app project into this one
